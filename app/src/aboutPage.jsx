We believe that every athlete, regardless of their level or location, deserves access to their data anytime, anywhere. That's why we are dedicated to developing a state-of-the-art dashboard that can display logbook data from rowing machines on any device, in any web browser. Our app uses secure authentication to read data from logbook servers, ensuring that all of your data remains safe and secure. At Filbot, we take your privacy seriously, which is why we never store any personal or workout data. Our mission is to empower athletes with the insights they need to perform at their best, and we are committed to making that a reality for everyone.</p>
